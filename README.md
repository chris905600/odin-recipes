# odin-recipes

This application is a small project to simulate a recipe website in which a recipe can be viewed, and in the selected recipe
site, a description is given about the meal, its ingredients are listed, as well as the steps that are needed to complete the 
meal

I used html because I needed to create a prliminary website to complete the task. I used VsCode because of its seemless design, and easy to use interface, it was also recommended by the odin-project. I used git and github to reliably manage
through different files and directories and save their progress when modified.

This was a project that was used as a checkmark for the html section of the odin project. Within its development, I faced 
some challenges with this project, like reviewing how to clone a repository from github to my local device, or familiarizing myself with html syntax which is new to me.

This project was made thanks to the odin project.
